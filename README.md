# EdD Analysis
A repository to demonstrate the work I did for the quantitative analysis for my EdD thesis. 

# The Data I Collected
Psychometric testing questionnaires / SRQ-A / Likert scale / what the statements were about 

# Analysis 

_Descriptive Statistics_
Measures of central tendency / 

_Inferential Statistics_


# Summary of Outcomes


# What I've learned

Pros - did what I needed it to do 
Cons - perhaps not the most efficient code you've seen but that's something I could improve over time (if I had time!)
